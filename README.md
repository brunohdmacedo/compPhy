This repository has an assortment of codes for model systems in computational physics. 
In particular, some representative models of statistical physics are included.
For example,

* [Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/compPhy/tree/master/ising)

* [Monte Carlo simulation of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP)](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/compPhy/tree/master/asep)

* [Python notebooks on miscellaneous topics of physics](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/compPhy/tree/master/notebooks)
